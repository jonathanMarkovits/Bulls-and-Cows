<ins><b>The game:</b></ins>  
The computer randomly chooses a sequence of 4 colors out of the 8 colors, in such a way that no color appears twice. In every stage of the game, the player try to guess the sequence and is given a feedback to his guess, based on the actual sequence. The player uses the feedback to improve and make a better guess, and will continue guessing until guessing correctly, or until he runs out of guesses.
